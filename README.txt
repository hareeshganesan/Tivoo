README

In order to run the GUI code run the MainGUI file.

The GUI is extremely primitive and commands are listed in the bottom text field.

If you follow the instructions it works happily.

If you are a bad user and do what you please then the GUI gets mad.

GUI design not approved for arts and crafts students.
